# Privacy Policy for FeederAce App and Firmware

**Last Updated:** 12/23/2023

This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data collection and privacy for our mobile application.

---

### 1. Data Collection and Storage
We have designed **FeederAce** so that it does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information. 

* **No Personal Information:** We do not ask for, and you do not need to provide, any personal information (such as your name, email address, or phone number) to use the app.
* **No Account Creation:** There is no registration or login process.
* **No Server-Side Storage:** Any data you create or input within the app stays locally on your device. We do not have access to your files, inputs, or activity.

### 2. Third-Party Services
The app does not use any third-party services (such as analytics, advertising, or crash reporting) that could collect your information.

### 3. Children’s Privacy
Our application does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since we do not collect any data at all, our app is naturally compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

### 4. Permissions
The app may request certain device permissions (e.g., Camera, Photo Library, or Location) to function correctly. These permissions are used **only on your device** to perform the app’s core tasks and are never transmitted to us or any third party.

### 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Since we do not collect user contact information, we recommend checking this page periodically for any changes. 

### 6. Contact Us
